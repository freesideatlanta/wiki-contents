If you are messing with Freeside networking infrastructure, here are things to check before you walk out the door:

* Is the public wiki available on the internet and from the space?
** It's unlikely you broke this, but you never know!
* Is the member wifi working (freeside-members)?
* Is the public wifi working (freeside-public)?
* Can you ping (member resource/server) while on the member subnet?
* Can you ping (public resource/server) while on the public subnet?
* Is the NEST online and connected?  Tap the NEST to get to the menu and check the network settings.  The NEST should be on the infrastructure subnet.
** For now, the NEST should be on the member's subnet.
