A weekly meeting held Tuesdays at around 7:00 pm. We open our doors and welcome the general public into the mysterious confines of Freeside Atlanta. This is generally more of a social gathering, but members can and frequently do show up to hack on their projects. We welcome guests and visitors to work on something if they wish, as long as our [[Policies|policies]] are followed.

The Open House generally involves giving tours, answering questions about the space, and introductions to members that share the same interests. Visitors are encouraged to wander around and explore all the things Freeside has to offer.

We encourage you to come out, and be sure to check out the [[Directions]] page for detailed information on how to get there, as well as how to acquire the gate key code! [http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta/ RSVP to it on meetup] and check out the other public events we have there as well.
