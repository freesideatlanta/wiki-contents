:'''When: Every Tuesday, around 7pm

A weekly recurring event, this time of the week we open our doors and welcome the general public into the mysterious confines of Freeside Atlanta. This is generally intended as a social gathering, but members frequently show up to hack on their projects as well. We welcome guests and visitors to work on something if you wish, just be sure you glance over our [[Policies|policies]].

The Open House generally involves giving tours, answering questions about the space, and introducing members that share common interests with you. As a visitor, you are encouraged to wander around and explore all the things Freeside has to offer, as well as the things you could potentially offer our community.

We encourage you to come out, and be sure to check out the [[Directions]] page for detailed information on how to get there, as well as '''how to acquire the gate key code'''. [http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta/ RSVP to an Open House on meetup.com] and check out the other public events we have there as well.
