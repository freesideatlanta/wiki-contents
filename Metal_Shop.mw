[[File:HauntedMill.jpg|thumb|Our legendary, haunted mill.  At night you can hear scratching sounds and soft whispers emanating from its base.]]

==Overview==
We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
