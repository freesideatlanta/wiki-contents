FY2013 May Report

Revisions
None.

== Reserves ==
Reserves stand at '''2.40mo''' of operating expenses.  They fell slightly due to the large expenditures associated with the electronics lab.  Weâ€™re still trying to target a full 3mo reserves in the actual reserves account.

== Income ==
Income of $2580 came in at '''$100 over budget'''.  Some income is below expectation since 15% of members do not pay dues on a regular basis.  To a lesser degree, because of cash basis accounting, future income does not reflect the dues of members who have paid annual membership.  Given that, income is actually on track and slightly higher than expected.  One of the large revenue categories that boosted income was classes, pulling in $890.

== Expenses ==
Operating expenses came in about '''$250 over budget''' at $2440.  The NEST already paid for itself in March and April and seems to be regulating the temperate better, and continuing to save us money.  One of the large expenses was funding teacher payments at $520 outgoing.

== Membership ==
36 Active [22 Full, 6 Joint, 7 Student, 1 Starving Hacker]
1 Probation
3 Suspended
