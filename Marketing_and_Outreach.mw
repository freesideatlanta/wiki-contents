=== The Big Idea ===
Freeside is a Nonprofit Organization with a mission of developing innovation and creativity in Atlanta. Because we're a Nonprofit, all of the work in the space is done by volunteers.

We have a lot of people that want to help out at the space, and we also get a lot of requests for changes/enhancements to the space as well as for Classes, Events, Projects, and collaboration with other organizations. In order to organize these efforts, we decided to create teams to divide up the work into specialized areas.

We created 3 main teams to tackle important projects in the space and assigned two Directors to be responsible for each and serve as the major points of contact.

=== The Marketing and Outreach (MO) team ===

This team is dedicated to building bridges with other organizations as well as organizing marketing efforts. 

=== Points of Contact ===

This team is headed up by Dr. Glass and Eldon, both Directors at Freeside

=== Major projects ===

*Collaboration with Atlanta Makers
*Coordination of Open Workshops and events to be co-hosted with other organizations
*The 3D Printing meetup
