I began my street art career in 1981 here in Atlanta. At first, I was cutting stencils of my poetry and painting it around town. That morphed into street sculptural installations and billboard manipulations. At the time, there was no “Street Art” movement, no internet and instant communication. I took very few photos of what I was doing. It really didn’t occur to me to chronicle these activities.  I was calling what I did “Guerilla Art”, since there was no encompassing terminology at that time.

== Carrie Nguyen ==

Carrie Nguyen (1992, Atlanta, Georgia, United States) makes drawings, paintings, photos and mixed media artworks. By contesting the division between the realm of memory and the realm of experience, Nguyen absorbs the tradition of remembrance art into daily practice. This personal follow-up and revival of a past tradition is important as an act of meditation.

Her drawings doesn't reference recognizable form. The results are deconstructed to the extent that meaning is shifted and possible interpretation becomes multifaceted. By applying abstraction, she creates intense personal moments masterfully created by means of rules and omissions, acceptance and refusal, luring the viewer round and round in circles.

Her collected, altered and own works are being confronted as aesthetically resilient, thematically interrelated material for memory and projection. The possible seems true and the truth exists, but it has many faces, as Hanna Arendt cites from Franz Kafka. By using popular themes such as sexuality, family structure and violence, she touches various overlapping themes and strategies. Several reoccurring subject matter can be recognized, such as the relation with popular culture and media, working with repetition, provocation and the investigation of the process of expectations.

I painted [I am not a number] in 2010 as part of my undergraduate thesis project, in which I used methods found in advertising and propaganda to communicate a positive message to the community. This particular piece was about democracy in the digital age, drawing from Iron Maiden's sample in "The Prisoner", the text serves as a protest to Orwellian self-fulfilling prophecies we've encountered in the digital era. The young man signifies a "little brother" figure, a young rebel of sorts who stands up to "big brother". In my mind, he represents hackers, artists, and activists. He represents anybody willing to stand up to tyranny in our modern world. The "copyleft" next to my signature grants the world permission to use and redistribute the work however they please. Information should be free and public. Art too, should be free and public.
