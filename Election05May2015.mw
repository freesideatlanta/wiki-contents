= Announcement =
Hello Freesiders! 
It's that time again for elections! Here is some info on how we will conduct the elections.
In order to run for director, one must nominate oneself. This requires emailing me (the secretary) with your intent to run
and platform. This will be preserved for our records on the wiki at https://wiki.freesideatlanta.org/fs/Election05May2015
Then you or I can send it to the email list.

There are many more details on that page, but the most important parts are: 
Electing 5 directors
Three directors receiving most votes will hold office for 1 year
Fourth and Fifth most voted director will be taking the remainder of the term of the currently vacant director seat 'til November.
In case of a tie one director may concede a vote for the purpose of breaking the tie. 
You must nominate yourself to run by May 3rd!
If you want to email your ballot, you may do so to secretary@freesideatlanta.org by 7 pm on the day of the election.
If you want to vote by secret ballot, ballots will be provided at the Member's Meeting on the 5th of May.
You must be in good standing both to run and to vote!
We should be creating a meetup event for this shortly.
If there are any questions, inconsistencies, or anything seems unclear, please shoot me an email and we will work it out!

Thanks,
Eldon
Secretary
