== General Workspace Rules ==
These rules apply throughout Freeside unless they refer to a specific zone or area. Note that individual zones or pieces of equipment may have additional rules pertaining to their use. This list is maintained by the [[Safety and Risk]] team. Contact them if you have any questions or concerns. 

:&nbsp;0. &nbsp;Do not be on fire. 
# [[Safety|'''Eye protection''']] must be worn in the workshop at all times. 
# Know where the [[fire extinguishers|'''fire extinguishers''']], '''[[exits]]''', '''[[first aid kits]]''', '''[[eye wash stations]]''' and [[safety|'''other safety equipment''']] are located.
# '''Hearing protection''' is available and recommended when power and air tools are in use.
# '''Do not''' wear gloves, loose-fitting clothing, unsecured long hair, ties, scarves or other articles that could become entangled when using any tool with a spinning or moving blade or bit.
# If you’re working alone, make sure someone else knows where you are and when to expect you. '''Keep your phone charged and close by'''. 
# '''Do not''' use any tools while [[Policy_DrugAlcohol|intoxicated, under the influence of drugs]], or while tired.
# Shoes are '''required''' in the workshop. Pants with cuffs, open toed shoes and sandals '''should not''' be worn while working. 
# If you break it or find it broken, fix it, or seek help from someone who can. A broken tool is a dangerous tool. Don’t leave it broken without notifying the members list or filling out the Maintenance Report form*, putting a sign on it, and/or locking it out so it cannot be used until repaired. 
# '''Never''' use damaged or malfunctioning equipment.
# '''Disconnect power''' before adjusting, changing blades, repairing or moving any tool.
# If you don’t know how to use a tool, find someone to show you how first (see Zone Captain, check Wiki, ask on Members mailing list, etc).
# Only use tools for their intended purpose. Tools that have been modified for a different/additional purposes need to be clearly labeled and documented. 
# '''Keep a safe path clear''' to all exits and emergency equipment, including all fire extinguishers..
# Flammable, poisonous, radioactive, hazardous materials, and biological samples must be properly stored and labelled. If you bring it into the space you are responsible for '''proper storage, labeling''' AND for providing two copies of an '''MSDS''' (One to be stored with the material, one in the central file). Do not use the kitchen or food prep areas for chemistry or biology work. Never store any non-food items in a food container.
# You are responsible for the '''safe''' AND '''legal disposal''' of all waste materials from your projects. Used automotive fluids, batteries, and the like should be removed and taken for proper recycling or disposal. 
# All spills must be addressed immediately. Cat litter, sawdust, paper towels, etc. are available. Think ahead and place a catch pan under anything likely to spill. For hazardous materials, attempt to contain, cordon of the affected area, alert the membership of the issue, and seek help to properly clean it up. 
# Do not leave oily rags on the floor or in piles. Dispose of these in a proper container (metal can with a lid, or special rag holders in the auto bays)
# When you’re done with it, '''clean it up''' and '''put it back where it goes'''. If you don’t know where it goes, put it back where you found it and find out where it should go next time. Clean and reset stationary power tools to a safe state. Workspace tables should be cleared.
# Before you leave, '''move your project into [[Member_Storage|member storage]]''', '''[[short term project storage]]''', or '''remove it from the space'''. If you have to leave something out (24 hours maximum), put a note on it with your contact information. [[Policy_MemberStorage|Longer term project storage]] exceeding your member storage must be arranged with the Projects and Inventory team.
# If you find a project left out, leave it alone if possible. If not, carefully relocate it to [[short term project storage]].
# If your project is going to create dust, try to control it (shop vac, dust collector for wood tools only, physical barriers to limit spreading to a smaller area, do work in the shop, not the front where possible). '''Sweep up''' the work surfaces, tools, and floor around you when you’re done.
# '''Welding masks are required''' for anyone using or observing a welder. You are also required to place a UV blocking curtain or solid objects between welding and other shop users to protect them from UV exposure. Let others present know you are welding and inform them how to safely avoid dangerous exposure.
# Spray painting (and other materials) '''must be done outside''' to avoid overspray damaging tools and equipment and to minimize health and flammability issues. (*If we want to be able to paint inside, we need an area dedicated to this, and a paint spray fan/filter system constructed).
# The equipment and power tools are not storage locations, workbenches, ladders, chairs, etc. Do not place drinks, food, works in progress, excess materials, etc on any piece of equipment. Do not use equipment to support projects being painted, sanded, or for any other task unrelated to that tool.
# Read manuals, signs, and wiki pages for tool and machine specific rules.
# The shop is for use by Freeside members. [[Policy_MemberGuests|Guests]] may use the shop only under the direct supervision of a member, who is responsible for ensuring that all safety rules are observed.
# Tools and equipment '''can not be removed from Freeside''' without the prior approval of an Officer. 
# '''Do not hack Freeside infrastructure''', or any tool or equipment without prior approval.
# '''Respect''' the space and its resources.
# '''Respect''' your fellow members, their projects and property.
