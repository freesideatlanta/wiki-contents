This page is to provide updates and documentation for the 2013 Freeside Board of directors elections.
Announcement of elections (sent to list):

Members,

It's that time of year again - elections are coming up for President and 6
Director seats on November 5th.

There will be some changes because of the new Bylaws, so Treasurer and
Secretary will be appointed positions selected by the Board.

We have also moved to staggered Board seats with One-Year terms for Board
members with 3 elected every 6 months. To get this process started, 3 of
the new Board members will be elected for 6-month terms so that we can hold
the second election in 6 months. Therefore, the 3 Board members with the
fewest votes will serve a 6 month term.

Also, as part of the Bylaws changes, Board Members are required to be
current Freeside members.

We will be accepting nominations until November 1st. Nominees can send an
email to secretary@freesideatlanta.org and Eldon will add you to the
ballot. You should also announce to the mailing list your intentions to run
with some kind of qualifications/platform.

*So that's - *

Throw your hat in to run by Nov 1st.
Elections are on Nov 5th.
Announce if you intend to run and email secretary@freesideatlanta.org to be
added to the ballot


Cheers!

Steven Sutton
