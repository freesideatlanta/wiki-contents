<TODO - A gallery of Dark Room images will go here>

==Overview==

The Dark Room is currently a relatively unused area of Freeside. It can be used for developing photos or silkscreens. There is some equipment left over from previous members, but those interested in working in this area will probably have to start a project to develop it. That's okay - we'll help. Check out our FAQ to find out how to get started with something like that.
