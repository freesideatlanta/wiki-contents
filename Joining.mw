=== How do I join Freeside? ===

So you want to be a member of Freeside Atlanta, eh?  Awesome!

Feel free to drop in to our [http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta/ weekly meetings] on Tuesdays at 7:30p to meet some folks and see what we've got going on.  If you like what you see, and there's a project or class you're interested in, then start showing up to the project meetings or register for classes.

We are a friendly group and welcome newcomers.  However, we do want to get to know you first.  Here is the process for becoming a new member.

* Find two sponsors. In other words, come to some events and meet some folks.
* Send your bio and responses to some of the questions below to your sponsors.
* After a week, if nobody has an objection, then you're in!  Welcome to the party!
* You will get all of the cool stuff that comes with being a member - check out the [[Benefits]]!

Quick re-cap: get two sponsors, participate in regular open events, be positive and awesome at all times, and then you'll get to be a member.
