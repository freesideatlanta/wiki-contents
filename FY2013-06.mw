== Reserves ==
Reserves stand at '''2.38mo''' of revised operating expenses.  They fell slightly due to the revised operating expenses posting higher than expected in our FY2013 budget.

== Income ==
Income of $3170 came in at '''$530 over budget'''.  Although the budget revision was higher, members that were lagging paid up past dues towards the start of the month, leading to a higher income for June.

== Expenses ==
Operating expenses came in about '''$240 under budget''' at $2350.  The NEST continues to create significant savings on our electric utility.  Members switching to Dwolla have saved us a modest amount of money.  Maintenance and repairs were minimal this month.
