Currently the phone system accepts incoming calls and With a delay can make calls and some help [[Equipment/Cisco_7960 | Cisco 7960]] see Eldon or Matt for howto <br>
The system doen't have a Voicemail set at this time!! <br>
This is the Google Voice Bounce Back method Commonly used by others before XMPP was created. I have however after some careful research and configuring we should have Several XMPP Lines. However, there have been reports that google is turning XMPP off, They have or some other crap. It will happen but what most people are refering to is Google has been Changing the Login Security, and detects what we are doing as an insecure app in logging in. Thus we must go into setting and change to allow and someone must logon to the account once day to once every 2 months... 

I have added XMPP calling on lines 3-5 and Line 2 is not configured correctly at this time stay tuned...

== To-Do ==
* <strike>Get Callcentric DID (or Other)</strike>
* <strike>Edit Sip.conf and Extension.conf With <strike>Callcentric login  and a Google account</strike>
* Test (DTMF TONES, calling, Dialplan, other)
* Change Voicemail Settings (send wav to someone)
* <strike> configure sendmail </strike> 
* Add A Custom Voicemail Greating
* Add/Change Phone book (xml)  (started )
* <strike>Fix asterisk Config errors (some syntax changes needed in some files due to update)
* <strike> Fix Cisco config </strike>
* <strike>Make a web page for the phone system

* Change some init </strike>
* Fix some internal port FWDing 
* <strike> Debug 7960
* Mount Phones </strike>
* Buy a 48v 1.5 amp Power brick or 15.4W per phone
* Make POE crossover adapters (4,5 switches with 7,8) (BUYING)
* Make Instructions for 7960 (see talk)
* Make NOTICE for phone

== Prerequisites ==        
=== Supplies ===
* Sip Phone (cisco sip)
* Debian Server
* Callcentric DID
* Google Voice account
* Python 2.7 w/ setuptools and simplejson
* pygooglevoice script
* tftp (phone config)
* apache2 (host directory and logo)
     
=== What was installed ===
* python-setuptools
* pygooglevoice script
* tftp
* apache2
* asterisk 13
   
==== Installing  Pygooglevoice ====
* We Ran the below code at root mainly to insure the install of pygooglevoice-0.5.tar.gz
 wget http://pygooglevoice.googlecode.com/files/pygooglevoice-0.5.tar.gz
 tar zxvf pygooglevoice-0.5.tar.gz
 cd pygooglevoice-0.5
 python setup.py install
 sed -i 's|https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLoginAuth?service=grandcentral|https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=grandcentral\&continue=https://www.google.com/voice|' /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/googlevoice/settings.py
sed -i 's|      galx.*|      galx = re.search(r\"name=\\"GALX\\" type=\\"hidden\\"\\n *value=\\"(.+)\\"\", content).group(1)|' /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/googlevoice/voice.py 

* Latter We installed asterisk 13 from source and Apache+php using the Package manager as well as the tftp server we decided on using.

== Main Files == 
=== TFTP ===
The Main files here are:
* dialplan.xml = dialplan on Phone ONLY 
* P0S3-08-12-00.load = Phone Firmware
* XMLDefault.cnf.xml = All Cisco Phone config 
* SIP(MAC_HERE).CNF = Phone config 
* SipDEFAULT.CNF  = All Cisco SIP Phones config
* *.PCM and *.RAW are ringtones (config-ed in RINGLIST.DAT)

=== HTTP ===
* NOTE: HTTP on cisco requires port usage in urls it will not assume port 80  
* The Directory is located here! and the directory is a simple XML file (freeside.php with xml headers) ever there is a limit of 32 entries  be warned If we need more we will need to use a database and fetch from there using a different script 
* the Phone logo I also here 

=== Asterisk Setup ===
We edited sip.conf and extensions.conf to our info. Adding a password to the phone and the correct Callcentric and Google info. Note: after editing the documents you must restart asterisk.   After the asterisk server was up we set up the TFTP server with the config files for the phone and the ringtones.. the config file had to be added to to include the network IP of the TFTP server, the web-server and asterisk install and the creds. we gave this user in sip.conf

=[[equipment/Cisco_7960| Cisco 7960]] POE=
* The Phone uses the old POE STD and thus requires a POE CROSSOVER cable to swap pins 4+5 to 7+8 
* The Phone also can use 802.3af STD B (power on non data pairs)
* For smart POEs put a 25k resistor across pins 1 and 3 and connect your phone to the switch using a crossover cable. (this will tell the POE to send power)
