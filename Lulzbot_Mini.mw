= About =
Freeside was one of 32 hackerspaces to win this printer as part of the 4th annual [https://www.lulzbot.com/learn/announcements/4th-annual-hackerspace-giveaway LulzBot hackerspace printer giveaway]

= Basic Instructions = 
TODO: complete instructions on use

* Log in with your credentials to the attached members-only terminal.
* Wipe the PEI surface with denatured alcohol to remove dust and skin oils which will prevent bed adhesion.
* Open up Cura. Select the print quality and filament type you are printing in. You can go into expert mode if you are confident enough, but the stock settings print great.
* Once your print is finished, '''wait''' for the bed to cool down. It will automatically push forward when it is at temperature. Then '''gently''' remove your print from the surface. Be careful not to scratch, peel, or damage the PEI surface!
* Turn off machine when done.

== Basic Operational Knowledge ==
* How to slice and send a job to it
* How to abort a failed job
* How to properly remove a print once it has completed
* How to load and unload filament (optional, but you'll be stuck with the loaded plastic type and color)

== Advanced Operational Knowledge ==
There are some more advanced tasks that not everyone needs to know to
print, but needs to know to troubleshoot:

* How to tighten belts, fix misaligned axises, replace worn out parts, etc.

== Specifications and Detailed Instructions ==
TODO: complete specifications, links to documentation, etc.
