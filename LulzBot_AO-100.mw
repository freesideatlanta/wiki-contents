= Owner(s) =
* Freeside

== Permissions ==
For general use by members. Treat equipment as if it were your own and put away as or better than you found it.

== Restrictions == 
TODO: specify all the restrictions

* Use only with members-only terminal connected to AO-100
* Use with 3mm ABS filament only

= About =
Freeside was one of only 8 hackerspaces in the world to win this printer as part of the [http://www.lulzbot.com/?q=blog/announcement-winners-lulzbot-hackerspace-printer-giveaway LulzBot hackerspace printer giveaway]!

= Basic Instructions = 
TODO: complete instructions on use

* Log in with your credentials to the attached members-only terminal.
* Check that the bed is all the way up on the sprung screws on all 4 corners before starting a print, or it will not be level. It has a tendency, if compressed when removing a part for example, to stick down on some of the corners.
* Use a clean paper towel to apply a thin layer of ABS Juice to the kapton tape surface.
* The only tweaks you should need to make for your prints are layer thickness and infill style/density related.
* Please do not change the bed level or limit switches.
* Turn off machine when done.

== Basic Operational Knowledge ==
* How to home
* How to slice and send a job to it
* How to abort a failed job
* How to properly remove a print once it has completed
* How to load and unload filament (optional, but you'll be stuck with the loaded plastic type and color)

== Advanced Operational Knowledge ==
There are some more advanced tasks that not everyone needs to know to
print, but needs to know to troubleshoot:

* How to level a bed
* How to replace the covering on a bed
* How to tighten belts, fix misaligned axises, replace worn out parts, etc.

== Slic3r Preconfigured Profiles ==
There are several Print and Filament profiles that have been preconfigured for Slic3r. Use these before creating or modifying your own.

=== Print Profiles ===
The preconfigured print profiles will give you a good starting point for adjusting print quality. If you create a new profile, be sure you '''name it descriptively''' and include the name of the printer in the profile.

* LulzBot-Default: Ideal configuration settings for print height, speed, and infill. Supports are disabled by default.
* LulzBot-Mechanical: Ideal for parts which will have mechanical use, IE Bowden extruder gears. Prints with more perimeters, more top and bottom layers, high honeycomb infill for strength. Expect long print jobs.
* LulzBot-Speedtest: Testing configuration for tuning printer speeds. Not guaranteed to work. Use at your own risk.

=== Filament Profiles ===
There should be profiles configured for filament colors. Different colors of filament will work best at slightly different temperatures. If you are printing with a new color be sure you save a new profile for the name of the color.

* LulzBot-ABS-Black: 235C extruder, 105C bed
* LulzBot-ABS-Purple: 235?C extruder, 105?C bed
