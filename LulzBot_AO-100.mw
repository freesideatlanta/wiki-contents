= Basic Instructions = 
TODO: complete instructions on use
* Log in with your credentials to the attached members-only terminal
* Check that the bed is all the way up on the sprung screws on all 4 corners before starting a print, or it will not be level. It has a tendency, if compressed when removing a part for example, to stick down on some of the corners.
* The only tweaks you should need to make for your prints are layer thickness and infill style/density related. 
*  Please do not change the bed level or limit switches.
* Turn off machine when done

* How to home it.
* How to load and unload filament (optional, but you'll be stuck with the loaded plastic type and color)
* How to slice and send a job to it.

* How to properly remove a print once it has completed.
