'''Approved: 2013-MAY-08'''

Freeside Technology Spaces (Freeside) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free hackerspace experience for everyone.  We do not tolerate harassment of members, guests, or visitors in any form. Sexual language and sexually explicit imagery is not appropriate for any Freeside space, including Freeside-related events.  Members, guests, and visitors violating these rules may be expelled from the space or event at the discretion of the Officers and Directors.

Harassment covers a wide range of behaviours of an offensive nature.  It is commonly understood as behaviour intended to disturb or upset, and it is characteristically repetitive.  In the legal sense, it is intentional behaviour which is found threatening or disturbing.  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexually explicit images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  

Members, guests, and visitors asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a member engages in harassing behavior, Freeside Officers and Directors may take any action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to: censure, expulsion from the space, and/or termination of membership.

In an emergency, please call 911.  If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an Officer or Director immediately.  You can reach us at either:

* Officers email: [mailto:officers@freesideatlanta.org| officers@freesideatlanta.org]
* Directors email: [mailto:bod@freesideatlanta.org| bod@freesideatlanta.org]

Freeside will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, call taxis, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe at our space and events.  We value our visitors and members.

* In an emergency, please call 911.  We are in the City of Atlanta jurisdiction.
* Dekalb Rape Crisis Center, 204 Church Street, Decatur, GA 30030, Crisis Hotline: 404-377-1428

We expect members, guests, and visitors to follow these rules at all Freeside event venues and Freeside-related social events.

This anti-harassment policy is based on the [http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy example policy] from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.
