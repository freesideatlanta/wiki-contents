=== Movie ===

Knight-Mozilla got public screening rights to a copy of ''Sneakers'' - they want to show that at '''9:30p'''.  This means we'll likely need a DVD player (or a computer with a DVD player) hooked up to the projector.

=== Invoicing ===

Keep receipts of anything you had to spend money on for the event; I (Treasurer) will reimburse you.  You can email me the receipt (best), or drop it off in my member storage bin and email me that you did that.
