Here are some ideas for classes that we think the Freeside community would love - 

== Electronics and Microcontrollers ==

There are a lot of great electronics resources at Freeside, but sometimes people need a review of the basics to get started. Students can pay for the class and/or materials for the following topics:

* Basic Electronics + Soldering
* ICs and Oscilloscopes
* Electromagnetism and Circuit Design
* Arduino 101
* Arduino for Data Logging / Ethernet
* Raspberry Pi 101
* Raspberry Pi Servers!
* XBMC on Raspberry Pi (RasPi Media Center)
* TI MSP-430 101
* JeeNode, Ninja Blocks, BeagleBone, NETduino, etc...
* Fun with Analog and Digital LEDs

== 2D and 3D modeling ==

Lots of interest in this stuff lately...

* Intro to 3D Printing
* Using the Laser Cutter
* OpenSCAD, 123D Design, etc... CAD basics
* 3D Scanning with the (whatever) device
* Prototyping with 3D Printing!

== Design and Production ==

Getting the message out and sharing your creations with the world! This is a pretty mixed bag, but it's hard to neatly categorize this stuff so this is what we came up with...

* Basics of Web Design / UX
* Ways to think about Product Design
* Intro to Screenwriting
* Podcasting on a Budget
* Editing your Podcasts using (whatever) software
* Arduino-controlled Camera Mounts
* DIY Steadicam

== Woodworking and Metalworking ==

Hands-on classes that are more likely to be smaller in size and more expensive. Includes a shop safety section at the beginning.

* Intro to Machining
* Intro to Woodworking
* Intro to Mold Making
* Intro to Blacksmithing
* Quick and Dirty Design - for Artwork and Prototyping
* Cosplay Shop Class
