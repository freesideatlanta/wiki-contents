Here are some ideas for classes that we think the Freeside community would love - 

== Electronics and Microcontrollers ==

There are a lot of great electronics resources at Freeside, but sometimes people need a review of the basics to get started. Students can pay for the class and/or materials for the following topics:

* Basic Electronics + Soldering
* ICs and Oscilloscopes
* Electromagnetism and Circuit Design
* Arduino 101
* Arduino for Data Logging / Ethernet
* Raspberry Pi 101
* Raspberry Pi Servers!
* XBMC on Raspberry Pi (RasPi Media Center)
* TI MSP-430 101
* JeeNode, Ninja Blocks, BeagleBone, NETduino, etc...
* Fun with Analog and Digital LEDs
