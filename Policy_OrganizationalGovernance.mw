'''Approved: 2013-JUL-13'''

In order to act as a cohesive organization, Freeside Officers, Directors and members will document, collaborate, and communicate decisions and actions taken that affect other members, or the organization as a whole. 

No Officer or Director will take any actions representing Freeside outside of their normal assigned duties without notifying the Board and Officers in a timely manner. Unless in response to an emergency situation that requires immediate action (examples: active hacking, vandalism, matter of member or guest safety) the Officer or Director should attempt to contact and collaborate with another Officer or Director on the proper course prior to taking any action. 

No member shall conduct business as Freeside in an official capacity without prior and specific permission of the Board. The Secretary will document the scope of any such permission granted.
