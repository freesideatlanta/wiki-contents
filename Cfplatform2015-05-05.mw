What is Freeside to me?

Fantastic question. Freeside is a big cement box full of cool technology and smart people, but it is also so much more than that. To me, Freeside is a culture unlike anything else I've ever found in Atlanta, both in and out of the tech community. It is a place where you are not defined by your job or your credentials, but by your passion and your desire to create and learn. A place where stupid ideas become awesome realities, and you are allowed to be the person you really are. I love that, and I want to do my part to help it thrive.

Ideas:

Education: Freeside has an enormous amount of smart people amongst it's membership, and that gives us a unique opportunity to teach other people what we know. I would like to encourage more people to take up leading classes about the topics they are passionate about, and to offer a variety of classes/events that will cater to both the complete novice and the seasoned pros.
Collaboration: Many members have been voicing interest in having more collaborative projects in the space. We have a vast array of skillsets and mindsets here, and need to put them to good use to create crazy “art”
Finishing Projects: Having led multiple tours of the space, I notice that a lot of people seem to get really excited about some of our projects that are currently sitting in limbo (the paint booth is a specific example). I would like to refocus our efforts into finishing the cool things we have that are taking up valuable space. Otherwise, they are just taking up room that could be used for other things.
Less Bullet Points
Mandatory Fun: Freeside is an awesome place full of awesome tools, but it is also a community of cool people who like to have fun. We should have more fun.

Why am I running?

I am running because it is the only way I know to give back to a place that has given to me. Every time I walk into Freeside, I am reminded that I am the dumbest guy in the room. I listen to people here talk, and try to absorb the information coming out in the conversations, but I lack the technical knowledge to contribute anything meaningful in that arena. I'm just not good with technology. What I am good with is people. I feel most at home listening to people, trying to help them with their problems and help them flesh out their ideas. It is one of my few talents in life, and I want to put it to good use to help this space become even better than it already is.
