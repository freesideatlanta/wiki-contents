= About =
The Kill-A-Watt is a tool to measure power consumption for specific devices that run on mains (120v AC) power. You plug it into the wall, plug the device into it, and the Kill-A-Watt will tell you how much power the device has used in a given period of time.

== Permissions ==
This is for general use by members while they are in the space. Measure what you want to measure over a period of time while you are monitoring the device you are measuring, and return the Kill-A-Watt to it's home in the server room when you are done.

== Restrictions ==
I believe this device has a wattage restriction. Please read the manual before connecting to high-load (>10A) devices.

== Caution ==
*Check the manual before using with high load devices.
