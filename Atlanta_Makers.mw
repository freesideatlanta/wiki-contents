=== Why we collaborate ===

There is a huge potential to develop hackers, makers, and artists in the Atlanta community. Because our goal is to develop the Atlanta community, we partner with lots of other similar spaces. That way, we are stronger together than we are apart, and we can appeal to a much wider variety of interests in the Atlanta scene.

Our mission is to develop the Atlanta community, so the more we can pool our efforts the better we'll be at achieving this goal.

=== Important Collaborators ===
