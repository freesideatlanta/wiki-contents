= Open House =
Every Tuesday around 7pm we open our doors and hold an [[Open House]], to welcome the general public to the wonderful world of hackerspaces.  The [[Open House]] is generally more of a social gathering, but members can and do show up to hack on their projects.  We welcome guests and visitors to work on something if they wish, as long as our [[Policies |policies]] are followed.

The [[Open House]] activity varies from week to week, but generally involves giving tours, answering questions about the space, introductions to members that share the same interests.  Visitors are encouraged to wander around and explore all the things Freeside has to offer.

= Board of Directors =
The Freeside [[Board_of_Directors| Board of Directors]] meets the first Saturday of every month to guide the direction of the space, plan and discuss how to best fulfill our mission, manage operations, and enact policies.

Meetings are always open to members and the public.  We usually meet at Freeside around Nooner EST.  Ask ahead or join our mailing list to find out the exact time and place.

= Member Meetings =
Member meetings are held the second Saturday of every other month to both inform and solicit input from the membership about the direction of the space, discuss policies, and address concerns.  Since every member has nearly limitless power to transform the space to suit their interests, the member meetings are an excellent opportunity to coordinate these efforts with others.

Member meetings are usually members-only and closed to the public, but if you really want to attend we probably won't stop you.
