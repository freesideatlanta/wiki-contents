The Yamaha G-eg 112C guitar is a Stratocaster almost-clone. It has the usual three pickups, modern 5-way pickup swithch, volume control and a single tone control. It's been hanging around the space for close to a year in a nonfunctional state, and last week (Tuesday, May 14, 02013) I made an output jackplate, wired the output jack, and put strings on it. It plays rather well as-is. It's available for playing and further hacking.
