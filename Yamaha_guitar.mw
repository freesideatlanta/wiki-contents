The Yamaha EG 112C guitar is a Stratocaster almost-clone. It has the usual three pickups, modern 5-way pickup switch, volume control, a single tone control, and an output jack on the side, or lower bout (like many Gibson electrics, and unlike a "real" Stratocaster). It's been hanging around the space for close to a year in a nonfunctional state, and last week (Tuesday, May 14, 02013) I made an output jackplate, wired the output jack, and put strings on it. It plays rather well as-is. It's available for playing and further hacking.
