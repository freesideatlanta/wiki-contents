Freeside offers public events, including classes and workshops, using Meetup ('''[http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta/ Freeside's Meetup page]'''). All events listed on our Meetup page are open to non-members. Some are recurring, informal meet-ups, and others are more formal lectures or hands-on activities.

Some of our events also have Facebook pages.

Non-members, also, can give classes and run workshops here, by cooperating with a Freeside member. If you are interested in giving a class or a workshop, let us know!

We try to focus on classes that can teach basic skills and make some of the tools and technology in the space more approachable. We want to give people the info they need to get started, so that they can develop using the tools and knowledge-base available in our space.

[[Joining | Freeside members]] are eligible to receive a '''20% discount''' from the posted cost of the class.

== Teaching at Freeside ==

Our classes are taught by volunteers, so they are fairly inexpensive. 

Classes are typically taught at a rate of around $5-$20 per hour. If materials are used, then an additional materials fee is included. If a materials fee is charged, the students must either use it in hands-on class work (ex. welding or mold-making) or leave the class with something to take with them (e.g., a 3D print or a laser cut part)

Teachers receive 50% of the non-materials portion of class revenues.  The instructor also receives the materials fee if he or she provides the materials.  If Freeside provides the materials, Freeside retains the materials fee. Though we typically don't do free classes, some teachers opt to donate their 50% to Freeside. 

Free workshops are covered under a different section.

Teaching at Freeside is a great way to share your skills with the community, get more people involved, and make a real, positive impact on the space.

== Why Classes are important to Freeside ==

Freeside's mission is to provide a place for education and research in the Atlanta community. We know it is important to make our space and community more approachable to newcomers. Bringing them in with classes, and giving them the tools and knowledge they need to be successful, is key to keep Freeside growing and changing.

To achieve these goals, our class structure has to take everyone's needs into consideration. We've organized classes this way because we feel it is the most best way for everyone involved:
