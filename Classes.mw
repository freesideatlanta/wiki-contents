Freeside offers many different classes and workshops.  Some are recurring, informal meet-ups and others are more formal lectures or hands-on activities.

We try to focus on classes that can teach basic skills and make some of the tools and technology in the space more approachable. We want to give people the info they need to get started so that they can develop using the tools and knowledge-base available in our space.

[[Joining | Freeside members]] are eligible to receive a '''20% discount''' from the posted cost of the class. All classes are '''open to non-members''', and non-members may teach a class as long as they partner with a member to open up the space for them.

All of our classes are organized through our '''[http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta/ Meetup page]''', with associated groups on Facebook. Contact Kendra at [mailto:vp_ac@freesideatlanta.org vp_ac@freesideatlanta.org] if you have any questions.

== Teaching at Freeside ==

Our classes are taught by volunteers, so they are fairly inexpensive. 

Classes are typically taught at a rate of around $5-$20 per hour. If materials are used, then an additional materials fee is included. If a materials fee is charged, the students must either use it in hands-on class work (ex. welding or mold-making) or leave the class with something to take with them (ex. 3D print or laser cut part)

Teachers receive a full 50% of the class revenue. The other 50% goes to Freeside, which covers fees for taking payments, running equipment, advertising the class, offering member discounts, and running the shop. Though we typically don't do free classes, some teachers opt to donate their 50% back to the space. Free workshops are called [[Events]] and are covered under a different section.

Would you like to teach a class, but you're not sure what? Here are some [[Class Ideas]] to give you an idea of what we've heard people request classes on.

== Why Classes are important to Freeside ==

Freeside's mission is to provide a place for education and research in the Atlanta community. It's important to make our space and community more approachable to newcomers. Bringing them in with classes and giving them the tools they need to be successful in our space is key to growing and changing with new members and participants.

To achieve these goals, our class structure has to take everyone's needs into consideration. We've organized classes this way because we feel it is the most best way for everyone involved:
