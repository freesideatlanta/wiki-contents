'''Freeside Atlanta''' (est. 2009) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit work space built entirely by volunteers.

Located just south of downtown Atlanta, we are a community of makers, tinkerers, engineers, programmers, artists, teachers, and lunatics. As a community, we have built out our space with tools and equipment for electronics, 3D printing, woodworking, metalworking, art, design, classes, and events. Everything you see in [[Our Space|our space]] was donated or built by members. 

Our members are engaged in amazing [[Projects|projects]] and love to [[Classes|share knowledge]]. We also develop and work with open source and free technology wherever possible, and try to release our creations under variants of the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses Creative Commons license].

You don't have to be a Freeside member to come to our events or take our classes. We encourage you to come out to the '''Tuesday night Open House''' that we have every second and fourth Tuesday at 7:30 PM, or to any of the other public [[Classes|classes]] or [[Events|events]] that we have on [http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta Meetup]. Come check the place out and see if this is a community that you'd be interested in [[Joining|joining]]!
