== What is Freeside? ==

[[File:Justin Leggett poster.jpg|thumb|250px]]

Freeside Atlanta (est. 2009) is a nonprofit work space built entirely by volunteers. We are a community of makers, tinkerers, engineers, programmers, artists, teachers, and lunatics. As a community, we have built out our space with tools and equipment for electronics, 3D printing, woodworking, metalworking, art, design, classes, and events. Everything you see in [[Our Space|our space]] was donated or built by members. 

Our members are engaged in amazing [[Projects|projects]] and love to [[Classes|share knowledge]]. We also develop and work with open source and free technology wherever possible, and try to release our creations under variants of the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses Creative Commons license].

You don't have to be a Freeside member to come to our events or take our classes. We encourage you to come out to the '''Tuesday night Open House''' that we have every week at 7:30pm or to any of the other public [[Classes|classes]] or [[Events|events]] that we have on [http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta Meetup]. Come check the place out and see if this is a community that you'd be interested in [[Joining|joining]]!

== Our Mission ==

Freeside Technology Spaces, a non-profit organization, strives to provide a space that inspires collaboration, creativity, teaching, and open projects for the Atlanta community. 

Freeside is a member-run, non-profit corporation registered in Georgia. We have submitted an application for 501(c)3 status exempt for education and scientific research purposes. In the meantime, we have fiscal sponsorship to accept tax-deductible [[Donations|donations]].

We are currently incubating [http://www.liberatedtech.org/ Liberated Tech], a non-profit to retrofit older tech for the Atlanta communities in need.  We host their events while they work to get a space of their own.

We built our space into different areas to consolidate where we work on stuff in the space. You can check out the different areas of our space [[Our_Space | here]].  We are located at:
