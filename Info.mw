== What is Freeside? ==

[[File:Justin Leggett poster.jpg|thumb|250px]]

Freeside Atlanta (est. 2009) is a nonprofit work space built entirely by volunteers. We are a community of makers, tinkerers, engineers, programmers, artists, teachers, and lunatics. As a community, we have built out our space with tools and equipment for electronics, 3D printing, woodworking, metalworking, art, design, classes, and events. Everything you see in [[Our Space]] was donated or built by members. 

Our members are engaged in amazing [[Projects]] and love to [[Classes|share knowledge]]. We also develop and work with open source and free technology wherever possible, and try to release our creations under variants of the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses Creative Commons license].

You don't have to be a Freeside member to come to our events or take our classes. We encourage you to come out to the '''Tuesday night Open House''' that we have every week at 7:30pm or to any of the other public classes or events that we have on [http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta Meetup]. Come check the place out and see if this is a community that you'd be interested in [[Joining|joining]]!



Freeside Technology Spaces is a member-run, non-profit corporation registered in Georgia. We have submitted an application for 501(c)3 status exempt for education and scientific research purposes. In the meantime, we have fiscal sponsorship to accept tax-deductible [[Donations|donations]].
