= What is Freeside? =

We are a hacker space collective in Atlanta, Georgia.

Hack A Day:

"Freeside Hackerspace is a 5,500 square foot facility that feels like it just goes on and on...If you have a project in mind, they’ve got the space and tools to make it happen."


TechDrawl:

"...it’s a place where people passionate about science, technology, and digital projects can meet, collaborate and hang out. It can be an open community lab, a machine shop, a work shop, a studio or a combination of these where people can share resources and knowledge to build neat stuff."

Creative Loafing:

"'You don't just have to hack computers,'" says interim President James Sheheane. "'You can hack metal, you can hack wood.'"                
"'That speaks to what we're all about,' Storey says. 'Making cool stuff out of nothing.'"
