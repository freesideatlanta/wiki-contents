Come get your board and/or card game on!

We'll be playing short, quick games like Dominion to long, drawn out games like Axis and Allies. We'll even play games that destroy families and friends, like Settlers of Catan!

Bring friends, games, and booze (if you're of legal age) and may the odds be ever in your favor.

Check out our [http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta/ Meetup] page to see when we'll be playing next.
