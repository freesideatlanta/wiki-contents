==Overview==

3D Printing is a very popular facet of the maker/hacker movement. Though they are still a bit difficult to use/calibrate, they are capable of printing 3D items based on CAD models and using extruded filament.

== Software ==
'''3D Printing:'''
*[http://reprap.org/wiki/Repetier-Host Repetierhost] used by the Freeside terminal to generate gcode from .stl files and command the 3D printers
*[http://reprap.org/wiki/Slic3r Slic3r] is integrated with repetier host above or used as a stand alone to generate machine readable gcode from an .stl 3D model.

: Printer Firmware
:: Sprinter

'''CAD/3D Modeling:'''

Any software that can generate an .stl 3D image file is suitable.  Below is an incomplete list of popular options.
*openscad.org
*tinkercad.com
*blender.org
*sketchup.com
*AutoDesk (various products)

== Equipment ==

* Wall of Spool
* [[LulzBot AO-100]]
* Thingomatic
* Cupcake 1
* Cupcake 2
* Reprap
* [[The Kraken]] (custom--designed by Redbeard)
* Member workstation

==Current Projects==
* Reprap Assembly
* ≠ Assembling the Kraken ***finally done, woohoo!
