3D Printing is a very popular facet of the maker/hacker movement. Though they are still a bit difficult to use/calibrate, they are capable of printing 3D items based on CAD models and using extruded filament.

'''3D Printing'''

* [http://reprap.org/wiki/Repetier-Host Repetierhost] used by the Freeside terminal to generate gcode from .stl files and command the 3D printers
* [http://reprap.org/wiki/Slic3r Slic3r] is integrated with repetier host above or used as a stand alone to generate machine readable gcode from an .stl 3D model
* [http://reprap.org/wiki/Cura Cura] LulzBot branded flavor of Cura, included with the LulzBot Mini
* [http://reprap.org/wiki/Marlin Marlin] firmware running on all 3 machines

'''CAD/3D Modeling'''

Any software that can generate an .stl 3D image file is suitable.  Below is an incomplete list of popular options.
