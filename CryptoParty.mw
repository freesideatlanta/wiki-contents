We're going to be throwing a CryptoParty every second Thursday from 7-11pm.
We have [[Detailed_Directions|detailed directions]] if you're unfamiliar with the space.
It's free! Just bring your laptop or other devices. 

You don't have to [http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta/events/125769632/ sign up] to come along - but if you do, it helps us prepare. Pseudonymous sign-ups are fine!

Drop in for a few minutes to ask a question or stay all evening and chat about privacy, security, and the interwebz.

== What is a CryptoParty? ==

It's a lot of things in a lot of places. For most, it's a practical workshop for anyone interested in keeping their digital lives private.

Bring your laptops, netbooks, tablets and phones - we'll help you learn how to secure them and your communications:

* full disk encryption for your computers and memory sticks;

* encrypted email, text messages, IM on all your devices;

* anonymous browsing and tracker-avoidance;

* censorship circumvention;

* password generation, databases and management;

* keysigning / extending the web-of-trust.

If you have knowledge and skills to contribute in these or related areas please come along and share them with us!

Plus:

* ad-hoc discussion of the laws that govern who can access your stuff and when; and, at some point in the evening,

* our regular round-up and discussion of some cryptography basics and the latest digital-rights news, opinions, and happenings.
