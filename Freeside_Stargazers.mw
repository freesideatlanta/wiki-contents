Dust off your telescope and come out for an astronomically fun Friday night. This is a casual amateur astronomy meetup started up by Rachel Peterson and Greg Cook.

We will meet every third Friday at 7:30pm at Freeside to view some of the latest cosmic images on the big screen and talk about current missions and events. Then we will head out to a predetermined location to set up our telescopes and see what’s going on out there. Feel free to bring a blanket, snacks and beverages. No worries if you don’t have a telescope and stuff… we can all share.

Anyone that has something to share on a cosmic-related subject, just let us know and we will give you the floor. And feel free to suggest videos, topics and stargazing locations.

If you are not a Freesider, you are very much welcome to join us. Kindly donate $5.00 towards a projector bulb and to keep Freeside going.

Also, check out [http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/ Space Apps Challenge]. Maybe we can talk about collaborating on one of these space apps at Freeside.
