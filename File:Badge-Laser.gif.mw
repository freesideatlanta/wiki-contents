FX: DRONE and RUMBLE GETTING CLOSER

WILMA: (EXCITED) Look here! Out of the window!

HUER: (EXCITED) Good heavens, Wilma!

BUCK: It's coming right down this way!

HUER: Wilma!

WILMA: BUCK!

FX: THERE IS A TERRIFIC CRASH

ANNCR: Say! Buck's wish for excitement certainly came true in a hurry! Great day, I wonder what that was. And I certainly hope he and Wilma and Doctor Huer are alright. What do you say, Pete?

PETE: Well I know what would make ME feel alright! A great big frozen Fudgicle. Jiminy! Can you imagine anything better than that fresh, creamy chocolate fudge, frozen ice-cold on a stick?

ANNCR: Fellows and Girls, what's the best, purest, nickel's worth you can get? Right — a Fudgicle. Delicious and full of helpful energy. Made only from pure milk products. Swell to eat and easy to digest. And don't forget to save the bags for those wonderful free prizes. Exciting gifts like cameras, dolls, sweatshirts, gorgeous jewelry and lots of other things.

PETE: And listen, kids. Be sure to get your free Popsicle gift list at your ice-cream store. Don't take no for an answer.
