What exactly comes with being a Freeside member?  Some say it's the opportunity to contribute to an amazing culture and community of like-minded individuals that come together to build magnificent creations.

Freeside membership comes standard with:

* 24/7 access to the space, its equipment, and materials
* Dedicated member storage box
* Members-only wifi access points and services
* Access to our members-only mailing list, discussion forum
* Access to Freeside's shared drive full of our organization's documentation
* Trello account that helps track progress of Freeside projects

But wait!  There's more, if you want it all:

* Blog access to post and show off your cool projects
* Wiki account with edit rights
* @freesideatlanta.org email address and account
* Linux accounts to our various servers
* Hosting your own server (with IT approval and setup)

We're not done!  Members from time to time also enjoy the following perks:

* Discounts on Freeside classes
* Cool swag like Freeside t-shirts and stickers, as we print them
* Collective and bulk purchasing power with other Freeside members
* And much, much more we really can't get into

The only limit is yourself.
