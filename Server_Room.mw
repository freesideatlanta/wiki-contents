==Overview==

The server room is where most of the heavy computing for Freeside happens. There is a rack with several rack-mounted servers, and currently a bunch of old computers that need sorting.

==Equipment==
* VM Hosts
** 1x Dell 2950 with: 2U 2xL5320 (Quad Core 64 bit @ 1.86GHz, Intel VT compatible), 16GB RAM, 1x1TB SATA Drive (Owned By Eldon)
* 1x RBP Reboot Plus Switched PDU w/Serial interface
* 1x TP-Link TL-WR703N VPN (Temporary! Interfaced to RBP)
* 1x Rackable Box (to be removed, putting it's drives into vm host)
* 1x Cisco switch
* 1x Comcast Modem

== Current Projects ==

* [[Vuvuzela]], Open Source Access Control
* VMs for members
* VMs for classes
* OpenVPN for members

== Members-Only Wifi Services ==

== Services Wishlist == 

* 1 physical Zoneminder multi-U box because of the MPEG encoder card for the coax cameras.

* 1 VM for Vuvuzela (access control database, etc) hooked up to physical serial for door rfid.

* NAT/DNS/DHCP VM 

* Distinct locked down network for infrastructure stuff (cameras, RasPi
for access control, etc),

* Distinct network for workstations, wifi access, etc. 

* Public and Members wifi, with QOS 

* A good physical drop in the classroom and the auditorium for streaming.

* VPN access point to remote in and access infrastructure remotely.

* A small NAS would be nice, and then look to leverage something like
Jungledrive on AWS for some off-site backups of access control, VM images,
security logs and video, etc.
** I would rather have this be a vm. The vm server can handle 6 drives. I think probably just use that.

== Server Room Rules Brainstorming ==
* We don't need any internal (public) web servers.
** Public as in open to the internet, right? ie, we don't want to be a colo for just whoever.
** I would be fine with (and think it would be a nice service) if we hosted a vm on the "public" network being a member's public facing webpage (they user our IP and it gets natted/proxied somehow), they just have to realize that it is not going to be as reliable as amazon, and we will shut it off if it gets hacked or goes unmaintained.

* Nice-to-haves, like a media server, etc, don't belong on the infrastructure rack/UPS, etc. If it isn't essential, we should monitor it, kill-a-watt it, figure out the cost to keep it running, and figure out if the users want to support that.
