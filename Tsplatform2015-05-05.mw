When I joined Freeside we had an off road wheel chair project.  Liberated tech was here.   Dr. Glass had left not too long before leaving a legacy of technology for the suffering.  Brainiacs was looking at brain computer interfaces with the possible use for traumatic brain injuries.
 
Now that we have 401c3 status we should be able to support such actions much more easily.
 
I would like to see more projects of the technology helping the disadvantaged and overlooked.  We seem to be at a low on those.
 
Most important is continuing our core mission of technology for all to use in all manners of creativity.
 
But I am a geek.
