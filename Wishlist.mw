We're always looking for new opportunities to facilitate projects/education in the space. New equipment can help us do that, so we decided to make a wishlist of some of the things that we need for the space.

== Volunteer Opportunities ==
* Electrical wiring: running new outlets, and...other activities... ('''certification required''')
* Woodworking, construction: help with shelf/hutch building for electronics, help with member storage build-out
* [[Artwork|Mural Art]]: artists, pick a spot on the wall and make it yours!  We also want input on designing logos for each of our zones
* [[Classes]]: Teaching at Freeside raises money for the space, helps educate our community, and can put a little extra money in your pocket. You don't have to be a member or an expert to teach a class, you just have to have some basic skills and a plan to share them.
* [[Projects]]: Volunteering your skills on projects (and [[Build_Out|Build-Outs]]) is a great way to meet people and help out. Check out our [http://www.meetup.com/Freeside-Atlanta Meetup] account for upcoming opportunities to jump on in.
