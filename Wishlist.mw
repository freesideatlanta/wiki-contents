We're always looking for new opportunities to facilitate projects/education in the space. New equipment can help us do that, so we decided to make a wishlist of some of the things that we need for the space.

* Electrical wiring: running new outlets, and...other activities... ('''certification required''')
* Woodworking, construction: help with shelf/hutch building for electronics, help with member storage build-out
* Mural Art: artists, pick a spot on the wall and make it yours!  We also want input on designing logos for each of our zones

== Consumables ==
* ABS: Our 3D printers need more spools in a variety of colors; we are good on white ABS!
* Paint (dark, black, matte): for shrouding the stage in the darkness
* Paint (brighter colors especially, not black/grey/white): we are painting an internet meme explosion mural in the front bathroom, and Carrie needs more paint
* Printer ink for the [http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&product=2512009 HP L7680]

* 4+ port NIC card for rack system, or full system: we are trying to build a router to create subnets, see Alan or any IT staff person for details
* Mounts for rack systems: stacking the pizza boxen on top of each other just won’t do

* Small to Medium plastic bins: We can start subdividing or replacing cardboard boxes storing things in the parts storage

== Materials ==
* Lumber: ask about specifics, but the two main projects that could use some lumber are for the electronics lab benches and for improvements to member storage
* Engraving plastic: for creating signage with Randy’s CNC!
