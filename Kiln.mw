= Basic Instructions = 
* Prepare your board with paste and components
* Wrap the thermocouple around the extra PCB and place near your board
* Set ''Toast'' to ''off'', ''Function'' to ''turbo'', ''Temp'' to ''max'' and ''Timer'' to ''Stay On''
* Plug in toaster oven and Arduino, and once the Arduino has booted press the right hand button to start the reflow process
* When the Arduino indicates it is time to cool the board, turn the temperature down to minimum. Opening the door slightly will speed up the process, but is not required and will confuse the Arduino.
