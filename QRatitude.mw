=== Open Source Inventory System ===

QRatitude is an inventory management system consisting of:

* an Android app for scanning QR codes (encoded psuedo-GUIDs) and uploading associated product data
* a Node.js web service that exposes an API to store and query the product data
* (coming soon) a website front-end that consumes the API

It came out of a discussion with Lifecycle Building Center, to create a simple and effective QR code based inventory system.

Check out the [https://github.com/freesideatlanta/qratitude Github page] for more information.  Or better yet, clone the repo and check out our progress!
