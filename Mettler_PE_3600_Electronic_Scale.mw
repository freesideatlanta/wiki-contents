== Restrictions ==

== Caution ==
Full accuracy requires 30 minutes warmup time and calibration, in that order. Read The Fine Manual for more info.

= Basic Instructions = 
* Plug in power. If maximum accuracy is needed, wait 30 minutes and follow calibration instructions in The Fine Manual.
* Remove anything from the measurement tray, then press down on the metal bar at the edge of the display. All segments of the display will light for a few seconds to allow checking for missing segments, then "0.00g" will be display.
* Put item to be measured on measurement tray.
* Observe weight reading on display.
* If the display says "OFF" power has been interrupted and restored. Press down on the metal bar to restore operation.
* pull up on the metal bar at the edge of the display to turn off the display (unit remains powered internally to maintain calibration).
* if it is desired to display other units of weight, follow instructions in The Fine Manual.
