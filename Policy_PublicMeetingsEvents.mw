'''Approved: 2013-SEP-14'''

Part of Freesideâ€™s Mission is to host Meetings, Events, and Project Teams open to the public. In order to facilitate these events, they need to be hosted and sponsored by Freeside Members who commit to being present, or making arrangements with other Members to take on these duties. 

Member(s) may host '''non-recurring publicly posted meetings or events''' and must coordinate with the AC team. The AC team is responsible for the calendar and should coordinate any schedule conflicts.

A minimum of two Members are required to commit to hosting any '''recurring''' meeting.
