A prepayment discount of 5% is offered as an incentive for a single payment of one yearâ€™s dues at the full rate (the annual dues payment or the prepayment).  The discount is only offered to the prepayment if it is made with cash, check, or money order.

Refunds are only available for the prepayment, in part or in whole, on a case-by-case basis with approval from the Board of Directors.

The member locks the prepayment amount at the full rate at the time of prepayment, so future changes to the full rate require no additional payments or credits issued to the member.

The prepayment covers 12 months of membership, from the day of the prepayment to the same day on the next year.
