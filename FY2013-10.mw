== Revisions ==
Some of the Comcast internet payments were not recorded for a few previous months, since the online statement via email somehow didnâ€™t make it into the administration inbox.  This has been corrected, with slightly higher expenses in those months.

== Reserves ==
Reserves stand at '''3.28mo''' of revised operating expenses.  We have finally secured 3mo of operating expenses, a common standard for businesses.  From this point forward, we can adjust our budget in the next year and perhaps start funding different areas of the space, or setting aside funding for specific projects.  Today is a good day.

== Income ==
Income of $2396 came in at '''$244 under budget'''.  This was partly due to members not paying dues on time.

== Expenses ==
Operating expenses came in about '''$347 over budget''' at $2987.  The higher than average expenses were in part due to funding the Learn to Solder project for Atlanta Mini-Maker Faire.
