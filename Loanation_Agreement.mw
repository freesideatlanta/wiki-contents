===General condition of the Equipment===
* Hold Harmless ( owner shall insure, freeside not responsible for damage)
* Notice before removing the item from the space (30/60 days)?
* Able to remove the item within a specific time frame is necessary (30/60 days?) notified by Board.

* Agreement to create and fill out the wiki page on the item, 
* lay out the expectation on member usage. 
* Charging for use? 
* Training required? 
* One on one signoff? 
* Member provides own tooling, etc?
=== Access Control, Security, Monitoring ===
* Costs for implementing or integrating into Freeside Infrastructure would be up to the member to provide
** access control system
** installation of additional camera to cover
** climate control
** power outlet needs
(Board or members may decide to cover or chip in on a case by case basis.)
(Ditto for costs to move the equipment in, and for removal.)
=== Specification Of Space Utilization ===
* Do not relocating it within the space without prior approval
* The Project and Storage team, and the Safety and Risk team reserves the right to inspect and lock out at any time if there is a safety issue with a piece of equipment, or to inspect prior to accepting into the space as a loanation.

This sounds like a great outline to me. I would also like a clause
requiring periodic training (minimum quarterly?) be offered for devices
that have a lockout or expectations of training (which should be the
same). It seems Paul is in general good about being available to train
on the lathe, but there have been times when this was not available on
machines.

I'd also like a clause around being in sufficiently good repair. I think
if a device is down for an extended period of time, then it should be
required that it be removed. (I'm thinking if a device isn't functioning
for 60 days, then perhaps the owner gets 30 days to repair or move it).

I think that's all fair. The training doesn't have to be from the owner
either. They can designate others qualified to do one-on-ones or training
classes.
===
*At least one training session within the first 60 days of
bringing it into the space (gives time to get it set up, work out kinks,
etc), and then minimum 2 others in the first year after that? I know I'd
have a hard time committing to once a quarter. After the first year, let
the Board review the usage, popularity, and demand and availability of
training?

* A one year anniversary checkup and agreement renewal.
