= How Projects Work at Freeside =

A big part of the mission at Freeside is to host group projects involving as many curious tinkerers as possible.

If you'd like to manage a project or host a meeting at Freeside, all you have to do is answer a few questions about what you'd like to do and we'll help you schedule and promote it!

= Scheduling for Projects =

Being crafty engineers, we have developed a system to schedule project meetings and classes around the highest availability of members and Project Managers.

Fill out [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NHnSzYc5cJzvWBzKF4E60TMFLA1YTIq-8Y9zihRRzpY/edit this form] expressing your interest in participating in different projects and classes and we will take your availability into consideration when recommending schedules for them. If you include your email address, we will contact you for rare and one-time events that coincide with your schedule.
