==Overview==

The Media Lab and Bio Lab are two of the latest additions to Freeside's hacker/maker zones. The Media Lab is set up for experiments in lighting, audio, automation control, interactive devices, user-interface design, recording, and other cool media experimentation. The area itself is one big experiment and is set up with a customizable Dreamlights lighting system. We're pretty excited about it.
