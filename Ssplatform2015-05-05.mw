Hey Everyone,

I’m running for the board of Freeside because it is something I’m proud of.  I’m a former President of the space and have been gone for the past few years living in pillow forts(blog post to follow).  I moved back to Atlanta recently for good and am beyond proud of how the space has grown.  Some of you already know me and for those that don’t I look forward to meeting you and helping out.  I’m quick to drop what I’m doing to help you turn a wrench or point you in the direction of someone that might know the answer to your question.  I will serve you all well from the board as I am proud of this community.  Feel free to ask me anything.

Slade
