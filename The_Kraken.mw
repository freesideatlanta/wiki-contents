= Owner =
* Freeside

== Permissions ==
For general use by members. Treat equipment as if it were your own and put away as or better than you found it.

== Restrictions == 
TODO: specify all the restrictions

* Use only with members-only terminal connected to The Kraken
* Use with 3mm ABS, PLA, and HIPS filament only

= About =
Freeside member Redbeard designed this custom build RepRap machine. In 2012, Redbeard taught a series of 3D printing classes/meetups and used the proceeds to donate all the material and hardware to Freeside. The printer was assembled and commissioned by Freeside members. In 2014, Freeside members designed and built a new printing platform that can be easily leveled, and built a new extruder assembly, drastically increasing the quality of prints the Kraken is able to produce.

In late 2015, The Kraken was rebuilt into a "Wilson" RepRap design by Michelle. The printer was upgraded with an auto leveling sensor. In February 2016, The Kraken was back in action and printing again. Info about the rebuild can be found here: [[Kraken Rebuild Details]]

= Basic Instructions = 
TODO: complete instructions on use

* Log in with your credentials to the attached members-only terminal.
* <strike>Check that the print-bed is square and centered on the platform.</strike> You should not need to re-level the bed unless your print suffers from noticeable deleveling. The printer has an auto bed tramming feature so the bed does not need to be leveled unless it becomes significantly out of level.
* Use a clean paper towel to clean printer's PEI surface with acetone. There should be a small labeled bottle nearby the printer.
* The only tweaks you should need to make for your prints are layer thickness and infill style/density related. 
* Please do not change the bed level or limit switches.

== Basic Operational Knowledge ==
* How to home
* How to slice and send a job to it
* How to abort a failed job
* How to properly remove a print once it has completed
* How to load and unload filament (optional, but you'll be stuck with the loaded plastic type and color)

== Advanced Operational Knowledge ==
There are some more advanced tasks that not everyone needs to know to print, but needs to know to troubleshoot:

* How the auto bed tramming feature works
* How to tighten belts, fix misaligned axises, replace worn out parts, etc.

== Slic3r Preconfigured Profiles ==
There are several Print and Filament profiles that have been preconfigured for Slic3r. Use these before creating or modifying your own.

=== Print Profiles ===
The preconfigured print profiles will give you a good starting point for adjusting print quality. If you create a new profile, be sure you '''name it descriptively''' and include the name of the printer in the profile.

* Kraken-Default: Ideal configuration settings for print height, speed, and infill. Supports are disabled by default.
* Kraken-Speedtest: Testing configuration for tuning printer speeds. Not guaranteed to work. Use at your own risk.

=== Filament Profiles ===
There should be profiles configured for filament colors. Different colors of filament will work best at slightly different temperatures. If you are printing with a new color be sure you save a new profile for the name of the color.

* Kraken-PLA-TransGreen: 205C extruder, 60C bed
* Kraken-PLA-DarkGreen: 215C extruder, 65C bed
