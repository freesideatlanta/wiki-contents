= Zone =
01: [[3D Printing]]

= Owner =
* Freeside

== Permissions ==
For general use by members. Treat equipment as if it were your own and put away as or better than you found it.

== Restrictions == 
TODO: specify all the restrictions

* Use only with members-only terminal connected to Kraken
* Use with 1.75mm PLA filament only

= About =
Freeside member Redbeard designed this custom build RepRap machine. In 2012, Redbeard taught a series of 3D printing classes/meetups and used the proceeds to donate all the material and hardware to Freeside. The printer was assembled and commissioned by Freeside members. In 2014, Freeside members designed and built a new printing platform that can be easily leveled, and built a new extruder assembly, drastically increasing the quality of prints the Kraken is able to produce.

= Basic Instructions = 
TODO: complete instructions on use

* Log in with your credentials to the attached members-only terminal.
* <strike>Check that the print-bed is square and centered on the platform.</strike> You should not need to re-level the bed unless your print suffers from noticeable deleveling. The printer's bed leveling screws are tightly secured and should keep the bed level without need for regular maintenance.
* Use a clean paper towel to clean printer surface with denatured alcohol (preferred) or acetone. There should be a small labeled bottle nearby the printer.
* Apply a thin layer of Disappearing Purple Elmer's Gluestick to the print surface to help adhere your print to the heated bed. There should be a gluestick attached to the holder on top of the printer. Return the gluestick back to the holder when done.
* The only tweaks you should need to make for your prints are layer thickness and infill style/density related. 
* Please do not change the bed level or limit switches.
* Turn off machine when done.

== Basic Operational Knowledge ==
* How to home
* How to slice and send a job to it
* How to abort a failed job
* How to properly remove a print once it has completed
* How to load and unload filament (optional, but you'll be stuck with the loaded plastic type and color)

== Advanced Operational Knowledge ==
There are some more advanced tasks that not everyone needs to know to print, but needs to know to troubleshoot:

* How to level a bed
* How to tighten belts, fix misaligned axises, replace worn out parts, etc.

== Slic3r Preconfigured Profiles ==
There are several Print and Filament profiles that have been preconfigured for Slic3r. Use these before creating or modifying your own.

=== Print Profiles ===
The preconfigured print profiles will give you a good starting point for adjusting print quality. If you create a new profile, be sure you '''name it descriptively''' and include the name of the printer in the profile.

* Kraken-Default: Ideal configuration settings for print height, speed, and infill. Supports are disabled by default.
* Kraken-Speedtest: Testing configuration for tuning printer speeds. Not guaranteed to work. Use at your own risk.

=== Filament Profiles ===
There should be profiles configured for filament colors. Different colors of filament will work best at slightly different temperatures. If you are printing with a new color be sure you save a new profile for the name of the color.

* Kraken-PLA-TransGreen: 205C extruder, 60C bed
* Kraken-PLA-DarkGreen: 215C extruder, 65C bed

== Specifications and Detailed Instructions ==
'''This printer is intended to be a dedicated PLA printer'''
