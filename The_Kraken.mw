= Zone =
01: [[3D Printing]]

= Owner =
* Freeside

== Permissions ==
For general use by members. Treat equipment as if it were your own and put away as or better than you found it.

== Restrictions == 
TODO: specify all the restrictions
* Use only with members-only terminal connected to Kraken

= About =
This printer is intended to be a dedicated PLA printer at Freeside.

Freeside member Redbeard designed this custom build reprap machine.  In 2012, Redbeard taught a series of 3D printing classes/meetups and used the proceeds to donate all the material and hardware to Freeside.  The printer was assembled and commissioned by Freeside members.

= Basic Instructions = 
TODO: complete instructions on use
* Log in with your credentials to the attached members-only terminal
* Check that the print-bed is square and centered on the platform.  The print-bed is currently not attached to the y-carriage platform...it is simply resting on top of the carriage. If the print-bed is found skewed, carefully place it back on the support pads and verify levelness.  If the print-bed is found out of level, follow troubleshooting guide listed below.
* The only tweaks you should need to make for your prints are layer thickness and infill style/density related. 
*  Please do not change the bed level or limit switches.
* Turn off machine when done

== Basic Operational Knowledge ==

* How to home it.
* How to load and unload filament (optional, but you'll be stuck with the loaded plastic type and color)
* How to slice and send a job to it.
* How to abort a failed job.
* How to properly remove a print once it has completed.

== Advanced Operational Knowledge ==

There are some more advanced tasks that not everyone needs to know to
print, but needs to know to troubleshoot:
* How to level a bed
* How to replace the covering on a bed
* How to tighten belts, fix misaligned axises, replace worn out parts, etc.

== Specifications and Detailed Instructions ==
TODO: complete specifications, links to documentation, etc.
* The Kraken is a reprap derivative built with PLA Plastic components.  This printer is intended to be a dedicated PLA printer
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid PLA Plastic - Polylactic Acid] or polylactide (PLA) is a thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch (in the United States), tapioca roots, chips or starch (mostly in Asia), or sugarcane (in the rest of the world).

= Warnings =
* Keep loose hair and sleeves away from all moving parts.
* *****WARNING***** Long/loose hair may become entangled in the z-axis(vertical) threaded rods and all motor pulleys and idlers.
* Kraken Print-bed operating temperature is 60째C (140째F)
* Kraken Print nozzle/extruder operating temperature range is 180-220째C (356-428째F)

== Safety ==
TODO: specify safety requirements
* Keep loose hair and sleeves away from all moving parts.
* Do not touch the printer nozzle/extruder while hot during print cycle.
* [http://www.natureworksllc.com/~/media/Technical_Resources/Regulatory_Affairs/Material_Safety_Data_Sheets/MSDS_4043D_ansi_english_nw_pdf.pdf PLA Plastic sample MSDS]
* PLA is not intended for: 
:(A) in any application which is intended for any internal contact with human body fluids or body tissues 
:(B) as a critical component in any medical device that supports or sustains human life; and 
:(C) specifically pregnant women or in any applications designed specifically to promote or interfere with human reproduction.
