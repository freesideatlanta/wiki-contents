= Zone =
01: [[3D Printing]]

= Owner =
* Freeside

== Permissions ==
For general use by members. Treat equipment as if it were your own and put away as or better than you found it.

== Restrictions == 
TODO: specify all the restrictions
* Use only with members-only terminal connected to Kraken

= About =
This printer is intended to be a dedicated PLA printer at Freeside.

Freeside member Redbeard designed this custom build reprap machine.  In 2012, Redbeard taught a series of 3D printing classes/meetups and used the proceeds to donate all the material and hardware to Freeside.  The printer was assembled and commissioned by Freeside members.

= Basic Instructions = 
TODO: complete instructions on use
* Log in with your credentials to the attached members-only terminal
* Check that the print-bed is square and centered on the platform.  The print-bed is currently not attached to the y-carriage platform...it is simply resting on top of the carriage. If the print-bed is found skewed, carefully place it back on the support pads and verify levelness.  If the print-bed is found out of level, follow troubleshooting guide listed below.
* The only tweaks you should need to make for your prints are layer thickness and infill style/density related. 
*  Please do not change the bed level or limit switches.
* Turn off machine when done

== Basic Operational Knowledge ==

* How to home it.
* How to load and unload filament (optional, but you'll be stuck with the loaded plastic type and color)
* How to slice and send a job to it.
* How to abort a failed job.
* How to properly remove a print once it has completed.

== Advanced Operational Knowledge ==

There are some more advanced tasks that not everyone needs to know to
print, but needs to know to troubleshoot:
* How to level a bed
* How to replace the covering on a bed
* How to tighten belts, fix misaligned axises, replace worn out parts, etc.

== Specifications and Detailed Instructions ==
'''This printer is intended to be a dedicated PLA printer'''
