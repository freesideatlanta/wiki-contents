Some deliverables absolutely require a licensed electrician.  Given that, we aim to identify all deliverables that do require an electrician, as well as other deliverables that can better be addressed by an electrician, assuming that we engage one for a deliverable requiring a permit.

Installing power for the kiln (many Freesiders await the ability to use our fine kiln) requires 240V power, and hence a permit, and hence a licensed electrician. A number of other desired improvements would benefit from the installation of 240V power in convenient places.
Installing power more conveniently located in the non-metal area of the workshop would require 120V power, and woul require a permit, and hence an electrician.

Some deliverables might not require a permit or licensed electrician, such as connecting wired outlets to existing power in junction boxes.

We need to finalize our agenda for use when conferring with an electrician. Jud has contacted two.  One has responded. However, these quotes will not address the agenda we will soon create, so these quotes will be used as references.

*** In Scope

**** Need an electrician
***** 240V
****** Power requirements 
- 50A to welding table
- 50A to kiln
- 30A to air compressor

***** 120V
- Junction box on east wall
****** Power requirements (@120V)
- lights out back
Qs about light: location, purpose (specific tool?), brightness, bulb type
Qs about switch(es): where? type?
- cameras
- workshop tools
****** on floor or from ceiling?
Floor seems to be currently winning

**** Might not need an electrician
****** light in kitchen
Do not want to use outlet just above light because that is not switched
****** Connect power to Form1 room
Existing work
****** Connect power to Art wall
Existing work
****** lights in hallway
Existing work

**** Do not need an electrician
Inspect every wall and ceiling for outlet boxes or junction boxes that need faces or prot holes covered

*** Considering to Move Into Scope
