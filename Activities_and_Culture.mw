=== The Big Idea ===
Freeside is a non-profit Organization with a mission of developing innovation and creativity in Atlanta.  All of the work in the space is done by volunteers.

We have a lot of people that want to help out at the space, and we also get a lot of requests for changes/enhancements to the space as well as for Classes, Events, Projects, and collaboration with other organizations. In order to organize these efforts, we decided to create teams to divide up the work into specialized areas.

We created 3 main teams to tackle important projects in the space and assigned two Directors to be responsible for each and serve as the major points of contact.

=== The Activities and Culture (AC) team ===

This team is dedicated to organizing events in the space, especially classes and projects. This team also organizes the Teacher's Lounge, where teachers and project managers at Freeside can gather to exchange ideas, collaborate, and help to increase the quantity and quality of classes at Freeside.

=== Points of Contact ===

This team is headed up by [[User:Steamboat| Steamboat]], Freeside's President, and Kendra, VP of Activities and Culture.
