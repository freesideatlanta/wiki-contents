At Freeside Atlanta, we have recurring monthly events where members get together to work on projects, engage in discussions, or just blow off some steam and socialize.

* [[Analog Game Night]] (First and Third Thursdays)
* [[TED Talks and Discussion]] (First Wednesday)
* [[CryptoParty]] (Second Thursday)
* [[Freeside Stargazers]] (Third Friday)
