The JAM is a machine that distributes art.  This project was fully funded by the [http://alchemyburn.com Alchemy] community.  We are on track to collect somewhere between 200-300 pieces of art to distribute, including works by Catlanta and Evereman.

The JAM explores two of the 10 core Burning Man principles: Decommodification and Gifting.  We express Gifting by distributing art through the machine.  Gifting trees are a familiar sight at Burns, but suffer from accumulating trash or trinkets.  By gifting art (a gift in itself) we create a sort of on-demand gifting tree.  We express Decommodification by not allowing the JAM to accept money.  Instead, art is distributed by the machine on a timer.  The machine lights up, and you push a button to receive art.
