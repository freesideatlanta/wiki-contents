== Basics ==
We have a $500 Budget (funded!) to build an educational project to display and demo at the upcoming EDExpo (late February)

== Plan ==
Build a portable, RaspberryPi based Lightboard for recording lessons/lectures/demos. A lightboard allows the instructor to write on a whiteboard in front of them while facing the camera. See: [https://sites.google.com/site/northwesternlightboard/ Northwestern Lightboard] for examples

== Status ==
The basic board is assembled and working. 

The RaspberryPi and camera is set up to automatically boot into camera preview mode with the image flipped horizontally.
