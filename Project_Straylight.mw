== Basics ==
We have a $500 Budget (funded!) to build an educational project to display and demo at the upcoming EDExpo (late February)

== Plan ==
Build a portable, RaspberryPi based Lightboard for recording lessons/lectures/demos. A lightboard allows the instructor to write on a whiteboard in front of them while facing the camera. See: [https://sites.google.com/site/northwesternlightboard/ Northwestern Lightboard] for examples

== Status ==
The basic lightboard is assembled and working. 

The RaspberryPi and camera is set up to automatically boot into camera preview mode with the image flipped horizontally.

== Budget ==
=== RaspberryPi Recording ===
* RaspberryPi B: $35 
* RaspberryPi Camera: $30
* Monitor with HDMI input: $100
* Powered USB Hub: $10
* USB sound card for recording: $10
* Microphone: $15
* HDMI and misc cables: $20
* RaspberryPi Mount: $0 (3D printed)
* VESA Mount to monitor: $0 (Laser cut from scrap acrylic)
* Software: $0 (all open source)

=== Lightboard ===
* 3x6" .220" thick Acrylic: $100
* 25mm extruded aluminum frame: $80
* LED lighting strip and power supply: $25
* Neon EXPO dry erase markers: $15
* Black canvas for backdrop (2.75 yards): $10
* PVC for backdrop stand: $15 (estimate as this was scrap)
* Baskets for markers: $5
* Misc screws and brackets: $25

'''Total: $495'''

== Todo/Version 2 ==
=== Software ===
* Video mixer to be able to overlay images into the background in real time
* Experiment with the RaspberryPi cameras settings for white balance, image stabilization, etc for optimal recording
* Script that automatically starts and stops recording of video and audio on a trigger
* Script to mix the audio and video into a single file for easier post-production
* Auto-mounting of a USB thumb drive at boot time and set this as the default location for recordings, or post-mixing drops to eliminate users from needed access to the RaspberryPi

=== Hardware ===
* Give the presenter a remote control to start and stop recording from behind the board. Keyboard or mouse would be fine.
* Redesign the floor mounts of the board to be sturdier and to allow for a heavier board
* Use tempered glass instead of acrylic for better long term durability (current budget wouldn't allow for this at approximately twice the cost, plus twice the weight)
* Edge light with solid white LED strip instead of RGB strip (RGD was available so was used although not necessary)
* Add a second RaspberryPi/monitor/45degree piece of acrylic in front of the camera for a teleprompter
* On-air light: Add a red LED to the VESA mount, hooked into a GPIO on the RaspberryPi, that can be turned on and off via script. This will edge light the mount with a red glow when the Pi is recording.
* Add WiFi and set up Network Time Protocol (NTP) or add a real time clock (RTC) to the Pi so the time stamping of files is accurate. 
* If Lightboard is set up in a semi-permanent location (The podcast studio?) set up better ambient lighting for optimal recording
