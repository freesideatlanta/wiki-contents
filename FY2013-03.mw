== Revisions ==

None.

== Budget ==

A budget will be submitted shortly now that all the data from Q1 has been collected, probably no later than the BOD Meeting on 06-APR-2013 (submittal for approval by the BOD).

== Reserves ==

At Marchâ€™s end, our reserves fell from '''2.85mo''' of operating expenses to '''1.86mo'''.  The reason for the fall was that a clearer picture of our monthly average expenses rose to around $2300, plus the influence of the annual payments on our reserves will fall as these amounts normalize through the rest of the year.

== Income ==

In this month, we cleared over $4400 in revenue.  This was largely due to the $1700 donated and earmarked towards the laser cutter.  Discounting this, we cleared expenses by a modest amount, for the first time this year.

== Expenses ==

Power usage fell slightly, and overall expenses remained in line with previous trends.

== Membership ==

We gained 4 new members this month, with 2 pending memberships.  The growth trend continues.

However, we sadly lost 1 member this month, and revised our count because one member had resigned back in November.  

We decided to include our two members with suspended membership in the overall count.  Our membership total is '''39'''.
