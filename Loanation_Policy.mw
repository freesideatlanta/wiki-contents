Freeside's workshop has historically grown on the generosity of our members and community loaning equipment and tools to the space. While we prefer to receive these items as [[Donations]] (we are a 501(c)(3) non-profit and your donation can be tax deductible) there are still some items of large value and utility that we are happy to accept on loan.
