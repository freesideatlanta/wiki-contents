Reserves stand at 2.59mo of revised operating expenses.  This is a small increase from last month’s totals, which was tempered by some past due members.

Income
Income of $2456 came in at $184 under budget.  In part, we were short because of past due members.  Lower than average donations and class revenue also contributed to lack of revenue.

Expenses
Operating expenses came in about $75 over budget at $2660.  This month, we a higher than average utility bill (both water and electric).  Some teacher payments from classes last month also “landed” on this month, which also contributed to bringing us slightly over budget.
